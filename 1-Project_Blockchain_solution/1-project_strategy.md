## Project Overview: Blockchain Use Case Evaluation

The goal of this project is for you to evaluate a potential use case for blockchain technology.  
You will research the use case, propose a blockchain-based solution, outline the architecture,  
and identify challenges to implementation. This project exercises your ability to analyze the  
fit of blockchain for a specific application.

You will create a presentation with the following components. Then, you will record a video of  
yourself presenting your entire presentation and introducing your use case and solution.

### **1. Use Case Selection and Research**

Choose a use case that could benefit from a blockchain solution.  
Identify the specific problems this use case intends to solve. Research existing  
non-blockchain solutions currently used. Explain how a blockchain-based implementation could  
provide improvements.

### **2. Proposed Solution and Architecture**

Analyze at least 2-3 potential blockchain platforms. Research attributes like consensus  
approach. Mention technical attributes of the blockchain.

Select an appropriate blockchain platform and justify why it meets the needs of your use case  
based on technical specifications. Provide a high-level architecture diagram outlining the  
core components of your proposed blockchain solution. Walk through the user journey,  
demonstrating how they would interact with the solution.

### **3. Challenges and Considerations**

Discuss potential implementation challenges such as scalability, user experience, regulatory  
requirements, adoption incentives, and other relevant factors. It is a nice-to-have to discuss  
how these challenges could be addressed and what alternatives could complement the blockchain  
aspects.

### **Video Requirements**

Once you've completed your presentation, make a video recording of yourself presenting your  
entire presentation. Here are some requirements for the video:

3-5 minutes should be enough to explain your project, but feel free to go into more detail if  
you need. Do not exceed 7 minutes in your video.
Speak clearly and do not rush explanations.

You can use tools like **Loom** or **Veed** to record your screen while presenting the slides

[Loom](https://www.loom.com/)  
[Veed](https://www.veed.io/)

Export the video file from your software in a common video format like .mp4 or .mov.  
Here, you can find a short sample video I made about a ticketing application built on Avalanche.  
Note that you don't need to add colorful graphics or designs to your presentation, but you  
should keep your slides simple and easy to follow.

### **Standout Suggestions**

Here are some optional standout suggestions to make your project go above and beyond:

Implement a small proof-of-concept demo or mock-up to interactively showcase core functionality  
like minting assets or displaying data. Tools that can help out are **Figma** or **Excalidraw**.  
Extend core functionality to a secondary use case, demonstrating reusability across multiple  
application verticals. Show how your system could grow to other use cases or become a full protocol.  
Discuss integration possibilities with emerging protocols like The Graph or Chain Link to securely  
connect off-chain data and computation.

## Resolution

### **1. Use Case Selection and Research (problem statement)**

Choose a use case that could benefit from a blockchain solution.  
Identify the specific problems this use case intends to solve. Research existing  
non-blockchain solutions currently used. Explain how a blockchain-based implementation could  
provide improvements.

### **1. Use Case Selection and Research (in progress)**

The specific problem that this blockchain solution is trying to solve are Real Estate Transactions.  
Currently, the real state transaction are in many cases slow, paper heavy, prone to fraud and expensive.  
Cost in traditional systems span from agent commissions, legal fees, title insurance, taxes and several  
administrative charges. This costs all added make up for a significant percentage of the property's value,  
making the process costly for buyers and sellers.
Blockchain solution aim to reduce some of these costs by automating processes and minimizing intermediaries.

1. Research and explain non-blockchain solutions currently used (in progress).

#### **Multiple Listing Service (MLS)**

[MLS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multiple-listing-service-mls.asp)

**What is MLS?**

The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is a centralized database where real estate  
agents and brokers list properties for sale. It allows agents to share information  
about properties and helps buyers find available homes.

How it works:

Real estate agents input property details into the MLS.  
Other agents can view, search, and share these listings with their clients.
MLS systems are usually regional and require membership.

**Strong Points:**

- Centralized access to property listings for agents and buyers.
- Increases property visibility and market efficiency.
- Facilitates cooperation between agents, leading to faster sales.

**Weak Points / Problems:**

- Not open to the public; access is restricted to licensed agents and brokers.
- Data can be fragmented across different regional MLS systems.
- Manual data entry can lead to errors or outdated information.
- Centralization can create single points of failure and limit transparency.

#### **Escrow services**

[Escrow services](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/what-is-escrow)

**What is Escrow?**

Escrow is a financial arrangement where a neutral third party (the escrow agent)  
holds funds and documents on behalf of the buyer and seller until all conditions  
of the transaction are met.

**How it works:**

- Buyer and seller agree to terms and sign a contract.
- Buyer deposits funds with the escrow agent.
- Escrow agent verifies that all contractual obligations (inspections, paperwork,  
  etc.) are fulfilled.
- Once all conditions are met, the escrow agent releases funds to the seller and  
  transfers ownership to the buyer.

**Strong Points:**

- Protects both buyer and seller by ensuring all conditions are met before money  
  or property changes hands.
- Reduces risk of fraud or default.
- Provides a clear, step-by-step process for complex transactions.

**Weak Points / Problems:**

- Can be slow due to manual verification and paperwork.
- Escrow fees add to transaction costs.
- Errors or delays by the escrow agent can hold up the transaction.
- Centralized control means trust is required in the escrow company.

#### **Title companies**

[Title Companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/title-company/)

**What are Title Companies?**

Title companies are organizations that verify the legal ownership of a property  
and ensure there are no claims, liens, or disputes before a sale. They also  
provide title insurance to protect buyers and lenders from future ownership issues.

**How they work:**

- Conduct a title search to review public records for ownership history, liens,  
  or legal issues.
- Resolve any problems found (e.g., unpaid taxes, disputes).
- Issue title insurance to protect against undiscovered issues.
- Facilitate the closing process by handling paperwork and funds transfer.

**Strong Points:**

- Reduce risk of fraud or ownership disputes.
- Provide peace of mind to buyers and lenders through title insurance.
- Ensure a clear transfer of property ownership.

**Weak Points / Problems:**

- Title searches can be slow and involve manual record checks.
- Title insurance adds to transaction costs.
- Errors or missed issues in the search can still result in future legal  
  problems.
- Centralized process relies on trust in the title companyâ€™s thoroughness.
